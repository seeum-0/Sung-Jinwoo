      <p><span class="highlight">Sung Jinwoo</span> (성진우, Seong Jin-Wu) is the main protagonist of Solo Leveling. 
         He is the strongest hunter in the world and the second Shadow Monarch, 
         having inherited the position from his predecessor Ashborn. Originally an infamously weak E-Rank Hunter, 
         Jinwoo got the chance of a lifetime when he was selected as the Player of the System,
         giving him the unique ability to grow in strength without restraint. As a result, 
         by taking advantage of the opportunities offered to him by the System, 
         Jinwoo eventually rose to power as humanity's greatest hunter.</p>

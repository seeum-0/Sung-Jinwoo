          <h2>D-Rank Dungeon Arc</h2>
          <p>Jinwoo struggles to survive in the Double Dungeon. 
            On what seemed like a normal D-Rank dungeon raid, Jinwoo and the rest of his raid party at the time, including Lee Joohee, Song Chi-Yul, and Kim Sangshik, discovered a second hidden dungeon inside the gate and decided to check it out. Unfortunately, they realized too late that it was a trap and found themselves locked in with no way out.[4] 
            Although the party was eventually able to satisfy the conditions to get the dungeon doors to open (mostly thanks to Jinwoo's instincts and intellect), by that point only six of the seventeen hunters who had originally entered the dungeon were still alive, the rest having been brutally killed by the statues inside the dungeon. Realizing that one person had to stay behind for the rest of the party to escape safely, Jinwoo volunteered to be the sacrifice, as he had already lost his right leg. 
            As the statues skewered him with their weapons and threw him around like a rag doll, a strange message suddenly popped up in front of Jinwoo's face, telling him that he completed the requirements for a hidden quest and asked whether he wanted to accept or reject his status as a Player. With no time or options left, Jinwoo accepted, making him the Player of the System and allowing him to survive the Double Dungeon.[5]</p>

          <h2>Reawakening Arc</h2>
          <p>Jinwoo discovers the System. 
            Upon regaining consciousness, Jinwoo discovered that he had been asleep inside a hospital for three days and that all of his injuries had miraculously healed, including his amputated right leg. He also noticed a strange program screen hovering above him and eventually realized that nobody else could see it. Although he initially thought it was some kind of joke and went back to sleep, he quickly learned that it wasn't when he got sent to a penalty dungeon as punishment for not completing the daily quest on time.[6] 
            As he never wanted to go back to the penalty dungeon again, Jinwoo decided to take the program seriously, which he later learned was called the System, and discovered that it worked almost like a video game, as it gave him rewards every time he completed one of its quests.[7] He also started to diligently complete the System's daily quest, which granted him stat points, a random lucky box, and a full status recovery every time he fulfilled its requirements.</p>

          <h2>Instant Dungeon Arc</h2>
          <p>Jinwoo goes on his first solo raid. 
            After Jinwoo completed quests over the course of several days, the System directed him to an instant dungeon located near a subway station. Although he was initially intimidated by the fact that he had to solo the dungeon and couldn't leave until the dungeon was cleared, Jinwoo persisted and was ultimately able to kill the boss and all the other monsters inside the dungeon all by himself.[8] Following this, he also started actively working out and investing in his strength stats, which prompted the System's magical effects to kick in and caused him to become much more muscular and masculine over the course of only a few weeks.[9]</p>

          <h2>Dungeon & Lizards Arc</h2>
          <p>Jinwoo kills Hwang Dongsuk. 
            Despite having grown to the level of a B-Rank thanks to his training with the System, Jinwoo quickly realized that his funds were low due to having not participated in a raid since the Double Dungeon Incident. Seeking to make some money fast, he joined a C-Rank strike squad led by Hwang Dongsuk as their porter, where he also met a wealthy rookie D-Rank named Yoo Jinho. Although the raid initially proceeded without incident, Jinwoo eventually deduced that something was off with the rest of the squad, not including Jinho, and ultimately realized that they were a band of lizards when they trapped both him and Jinho inside the boss room.[10] 
            Although Jinwoo was able to kill the boss, Hwang and his mates quickly returned and attempted to kill both him and Jinho so that they could hog all the raid profits to themselves. In response, the System gave him a quest to kill Hwang and his men, and Jinwoo followed through, easily slaughtering them all with his dagger.[11]</p>

          <h2>Dungeon & Prisoners Arc</h2>
          <p>Jinwoo and Jinho talk business. 
            About a day later, Jinwoo received a call from Jinho and the two met up at a local coffee shop, where Jinho thanked him for saving his life and asked him if they could form a strike squad together. Although Jinwoo initially refused, he changed his mind when Jinho explained that it would only be temporary and the two of them eventually struck a deal; Jinwoo would help Jinho finish 19 more raids so that he could become a guild master. In exchange, Jinho would keep Jinwoo's true strength a secret and give him a building worth 30B won (26M USD) once all 19 raids were complete.[12] 
            Deciding to test himself out before he started going on raids with Jinho, Jinwoo entered an S-Rank instant dungeon called the Demon Castle and was almost immediately confronted by Cerberus, the dungeon's first boss. Although Jinwoo was able to kill Cerberus, he nearly died doing so and only won because of his Status Recovery skill. Realizing that it was suicide to venture any further into the dungeon, Jinwoo decided to return when he was stronger.[13]</p>
